# Snake-Console-App
The classic snake game I quickly created using the Console Application in C++

The game acts like an ordinary game of snake, where the player moves around the area eating pieces of fruit to grow bigger.

However, the project also includes an Ai Mode, allowing the snake to take over the game and calculate the path to each fruit.
This is done using the A* Pathfinding Algorithm.

This Ai Algorithm is not perfect however, as the snake is still capable of getting trapped and ending the game.
